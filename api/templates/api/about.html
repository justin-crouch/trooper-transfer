                    The only things you should know about me is that I served in the
                    United States Army from June 2020 - November 2023. My first and
                    last unit was 4th Squadron 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Rose Barracks,
                    Germany. I was a scout (19D). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout most of my career, I drove fat, slow, and useless military
                    vehicles called <em>Strykers</em>. The leaders I chauffeured in my
                    unit, in chronological order:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Platoon Senior Scout (E-6): 4 months</li>
                        <li>Platoon Sergeant (E-7): 1 year 6 months</li>
                        <li>Troop Executive Officer (O-2): 4 months</li>
                        <li>Troop Commander (O-3): 4 months</li>
                    </ul>

                    There were plenty others I drove for, but mainly during short training
                    events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the times I was not driving, I was a dismount and a gunner
                    on the Dragoon Stryker platform. For both roles, my instructors
                    were the best within my Troop, and in the Squadron at some points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of my respect goes to SSG John Paul Wendt, who earned
                    <em>Dragoon Top Gun</em> two years in a row, for teaching me everything
                    about the Dragoon weapon system; the same respect also goes towards
                    SGT Tyler Nez and SGT Judah Wilkinson for providing the best dismount
                    and life training I could ever obtain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before the Army, I was an honors student at Louisiana Tech University 
                    for two years. During the first year, I studied Cyber Engineering.
                    Afterwards, I switched to Computer Science focusing in Cyber
                    Security. I did not enjoy the teaching methods from my professors,
                    so I left school with a 3.6 GPA and joined the Army.
